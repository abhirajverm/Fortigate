Technical Tip: Firewall does not block incoming (WAN to LAN) connection even though deny policy Description This article describes a scenario where the firewall does not block the incoming WAN to LAN connection for a specific IP even though a deny policy is configured.

There is an inbound NAT to access an internal web server from external network but we wish to block one specific external IP from accessing it.

Even though a deny policy is configured above the allowed policy with the source as the IP of the external client, still it does not trigger the firewall policy.

Solution VIP

``*** **In order to block the traffic from the denied source, it is necessary to edit the denied firewall policy from the CLI and run the following command:

set match-vip enable
Note:****``
Since 6.4.3 it is only possible to use this option for DENY policies. It is not available anymore for ACCEPT policies

After enabling the above option,the DNATed packets that are not matched by a VIP policy are matched with the general policy where they can be explicitly dropped and logged.

Or

Always configure the deny policy with the destination address as the VIP for which traffic is denied instead of 'All'.
