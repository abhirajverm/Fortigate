 FortiOS, 6.4.3 and above is using the Anycast method to address the Fortiguard servers.
Relying on Fortinet DNS servers, the FortiGate will get a single IP address for the domain name of each FortiGuard service.

In some circumstances Anycast does not work:


This can be verified with the debug command '# diagnose debug rating':

If a high value of the current loss is noticed, run '# execute traceroute X.X.X.X' to see if the FortiGuard server can be reached (while X.X.X.X is the failing IP of '# diagnose debug rating').

If the Server cannot be reached, choose between the following options to workaround this issue:

1) Switch to other Anycast servers:
 
# config system fortiguard                                   
   set fortiguard-anycast-source aws                           
end                         
 
2) Disable Anycast and use HTTPS with port 8888.
 
# config system fortiguard
    set fortiguard-anycast disable
    set protocol https 
    set port 8888
end
 
3) Disable Anycast and use UDP with Port 53.
 
# config system fortiguard
   set fortiguard-anycast disable
   set protocol udp
   set port 53
end
